# Machine Learning Practice Exercises

This repository contains my hands-on machine learning practice exercises as I learn and grow in the field. It includes small projects, experiments, and concept-based tasks using real or synthetic data.

## Contents

* **Supervised Learning**
  Classification and regression tasks using algorithms like KNN, Decision Trees, SVM, etc.

* **Unsupervised Learning**
  Clustering and dimensionality reduction with K-Means, PCA, and more.

* **Model Evaluation**
  Accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, confusion matrices, cross-validation.

* **Data Preprocessing**
  Cleaning, encoding, scaling, feature selection and engineering.

* **Mini Projects**
  End-to-end exercises combining the full ML pipeline on small datasets.

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* scikit-learn
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebooks

## How to Use

1. Clone the repo
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git`

2. Navigate to the folder
   `cd your-repo-name`

3. Open Jupyter Notebooks to explore and run the code.

## Goals

* Reinforce theoretical knowledge with practical application
* Build a portfolio of ML code examples
* Track progress and share learning
